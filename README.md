## Comments

Committed solutions are solutions that were submitted to the contest, after refactoring. Refactoring is done after each part is completed and may involve replacing hard-coded values with functions, renaming variables, extracting helper functions, etc. It does not involve major logic changes.

In a first stage, I don't attempt to be clever and I try to focus on readability instead, keeping in mind extensibility when relevant.

To start with, performance is measured (imperfectly) by timing the average execution. Code is ran on a 2019 MacBook Pro.
